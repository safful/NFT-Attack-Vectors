## NFT Swap Scams

### Descriptions:
Besides NFT marketplaces, another way to trade NFTs is through “swap” services, where participants trade their NFTs rather than buy or sell them for crypto assets.

Typical scams involve perpetrators pretending to be traders on NFT-related Discord servers. Proposing an often highly-favorable deal to gauge interest, scammers then invite victims to facilitate the swap using their scam site that seizes their victims’ NFTs.

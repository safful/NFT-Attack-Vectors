## Bugs in Platform

### Description
There are many cases in which unforeseen bugs or issues exist with platforms
that are poorly documented or understood, even by the platform themselves. Such
bugs result in unwanted actions that result in a negative experience for the platform
users or may end up in catastrophic losses.

### Example : Glitch kept NFT on sale when users intended to remove them from the sale

Let us take the example of Carson Turner, an NFT collector, who accuses a buyer of
exploiting a glitch in OpenSea, and acquiring an NFT that they had no intention of
selling.

Issue: If a person transfers an NFT listed for sale on OpenSea out of their wallet
and back again, it appears not to be for sale despite still being available to buyers.
Some people have mistakenly thought they could use this "hack" to delist NFTs if they
change their mind about selling them in order to avoid the 'gas fees' (network usage
fees) associated with canceling a sale.

This "glitch" resulted in Turner's Bored Ape #2643 NFT being bought even
though he thought it was no longer for sale, and he ended up spending 10 ETH (about
$38,000) on getting back ownership of this particular NFT.

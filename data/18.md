## Code Exploits

### Description
As with other decentralized applications, smart contract-based marketplaces are prone to code exploits. These can place NFTs stored in escrow by marketplaces at risk, or initiate unintentional listings, transfers or purchases. Fortunately, confirmed instances of marketplace code exploits remain small.
Code exploits do not necessarily involve NFTs themselves, but rather the underlying smart contracts that govern the operation of their affiliated protocol or platform. Nevertheless, there have been cases where NFT projects themselves have involved flawed code. Such flaws may affect the quantity and nature of the NFTs minted and – depending on the nature of the exploit – cause a wider fluctuation in the affected asset’s floor price.

## Phishing Scams

### Description:
Phishing scams are possibly the most common scam observed in the NFT community, and perhaps across
the wider crypto community as a whole. They involve fake malicious sites that compromise victims’
cryptoassets through either one of two main ways:

1. Through a fake pop-up – posing as the login panel of a reputable custodial wallet provider – that steals
victims’ wallet information once they are entered.
2. Through encouraging victims to inadvertently sign malicious transactions so that scammers, posing as
a legitimate NFT project, can steal their NFTs. This makes use of the ‘SetApprovalForAll() function in the
ERC721 and ERC1155 standards, which allow – per wallet owners’ approval – for others to manage their
assets.

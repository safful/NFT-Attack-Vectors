## Impersonation scams

### Description:
Impersonation scams involve criminals pretending to be support staff of NFT marketplaces or custodial wallet services. Active on social media, scammers prey on individuals publicly complaining about bugs and technical difficulties, encouraging them to make contact via direct message so that their issues can be resolved. Scammers then ask users to provide their wallet seeds, to which victims – believing them to be genuine support staff – will comply.

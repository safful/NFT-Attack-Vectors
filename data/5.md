## NFT Duplicity

### Description:
NFT duplicates can be minted too to lure gullible buyers and there is no way this duplicity can be stopped. But then the NFT market is booming all over. So much so that even multinational tech conglomerates like Meta (previously Facebook) are reportedly planning to dive into the world of NFTs.

It is easy for anyone to copy an NFT art. It is even possible to convert someone elseâ€™s artwork into an NFT and sell at online marketplaces.

## Recovery Scams

### Description:
Almost all publicly-reported NFT (or other) scams on social media automatically trigger numerous bots that urge the victim to contact some form of entity that can supposedly recover stolen assets. Some scammers may not be bots and instead engage in conversation before inviting the victim to contact a fake recovery expert. All such messages are scams – and seek to defraud the victim further by inciting a ‘pre-payment’ for ‘recovery services’ that are never rendered.
